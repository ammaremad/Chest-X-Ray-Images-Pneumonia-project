## README for Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Project  

### Project Overview  

The Chest X-Ray Images project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately classify chest X-ray images as either "Normal" or "Pneumonia." This initiative utilizes a dataset composed of 5,863 X-ray images sourced from pediatric patients at the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center. The dataset is structured into three main directories for training, testing, and validation, facilitating systematic model development and evaluation.  

### Dataset Structure  

The dataset consists of the following directories:  

- **train**: Contains the training images categorized into:  
  - Normal  
  - Pneumonia  
- **val**: Contains validation images in the same structure.  
- **test**: Contains test images structured similarly.  

### Data Acquisition  

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle. Ensure that the Kaggle API is configured properly by placing the `kaggle.json` file in the appropriate directory for authentication.  

#### Commands to Download Data  

```bash  
!mkdir ~/.kaggle  
!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/  
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json  
!kaggle datasets download -d paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia  
!unzip chest-xray-pneumonia.zip  
```  

### Data Preprocessing  

The data preprocessing involves:  
- Quality control: Removal of low-quality images before analysis.  
- Image normalization and augmentation techniques for better model training. The augmentation includes:  
  - Rescaling  
  - Rotation  
  - Width and height shifting  
  - Shear and zooming  
  - Horizontal flipping  

#### Example Code for Data Augmentation  

```python  
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator  

# Training data  
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(  
    rescale=1./255,  
    rotation_range=40,  
    width_shift_range=0.2,  
    height_shift_range=0.2,  
    shear_range=0.2,  
    zoom_range=0.2,  
    horizontal_flip=True,  
    fill_mode='nearest'  
)  
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(  
    train_dir,  
    target_size=(100, 100),  
    batch_size=32,  
    class_mode='binary'  
)  

# Validation data  
val_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)  
val_generator = val_datagen.flow_from_directory(  
    val_dir,  
    target_size=(100, 100),  
    batch_size=32,  
    class_mode='binary'  
)  
```  

### Model Development  

The project employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the classification task. Transfer learning techniques such as VGG16 are utilized to enhance model performance.  

#### Steps for Training the Model  

1. Load the pre-trained VGG16 model.  
2. Add custom layers for classification.  
3. Compile the model specifying the optimizer and loss function.  
4. Train the model using the training generator while validating with the validation generator.  

### Evaluation  

After training, evaluate the model using the test dataset to assess its accuracy and loss metrics.  

#### Example Code for Evaluation  

```python  
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model  

best_model_cnn = load_model('best_model_cnn.keras')  
accuracy, loss = best_model_cnn.evaluate(test_generator)  
print(f"Test Loss: {loss:.4f}")  
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")  
```  

### Future Work  

Further improvements can include:  
- Expanding the dataset to increase model generalization.  
- Exploring additional machine learning algorithms and architectures.  
- Conducting real-world clinical trials to evaluate model efficacy.
